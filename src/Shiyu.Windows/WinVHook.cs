/// Takes Win+V over from the system clipboard panel, through a low-level
/// keyboard hook driven by the tested <see cref="WinVFilter"/>.
///
/// Two properties the takeover owes the user, both structural here:
/// the hook lives inside this process, so a crash or a kill removes it and
/// Win+V falls back to Windows on its own — nothing to clean up, nothing to
/// forget; and Dispose unhooks on the spot, so switching the setting off
/// restores the system behaviour without a restart.
///
/// Threading (O-16): the hook is installed on and serviced by a dedicated
/// pumped thread — see <see cref="LowLevelHookThread"/> for why the UI thread
/// may not own a low-level hook. The callback and the filter state machine it
/// feeds run on that hook thread and nowhere else (nothing else in this class
/// touches the filter, so there is no cross-thread state to guard); the mask
/// injection and the app trigger below stay POSTED to the context captured
/// here at construction, exactly where they ran before the migration. The
/// hook handle reaches the callback as its first argument (see
/// <see cref="LowLevelHookThread"/> for why a field read-back would race).
